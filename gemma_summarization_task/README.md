# Gemma Summarization Task Documentation

This document describes the Gemma Summarization Task component, its objectives, architecture, and usage.

## 1. Overview
The primary goal of this component is to utilize Gemma language models for generating summaries of textual content, likely derived from public consultations or related legal documents processed by the AI4Deliberation pipeline.

It may involve:
- Preprocessing text for Gemma models.
- Implementing multi-stage summarization strategies (e.g., abstractive, extractive, iterative refinement).
- Handling potentially long documents.
- Evaluating summary quality.

## 2. Key Scripts and Modules
(To be filled based on investigation of the folder contents. Examples below)
- `orchestrate_summarization_v2.py`: Likely the main script for running the summarization workflow.
- `prompts.py` (if exists): Contains prompt templates for Gemma.
- `utils.py` (if exists): Helper functions for data loading, preprocessing, etc.
- `run_summarization.py`: Potentially another entry point or a part of the workflow.

## 3. Workflow
(Detailed description of the summarization process, from input text to final summary).
- Input data format.
- Preprocessing steps.
- Interaction with Gemma models (API calls, local inference).
- Postprocessing of summaries.

## 4. Programmatic Usage
(How to run the summarization task, required inputs, parameters).

```python
# Example (conceptual)
# from .orchestrate_summarization_v2 import summarize_consultation
#
# summary = summarize_consultation(consultation_id="some_id", text_content="...")
```

## 5. Configuration
(Details on how to configure the summarization task, e.g., model choice, API keys, length constraints).

## 6. Dependencies
(List any specific Python packages or external dependencies beyond the main project ones).

## 7. Future Enhancements & TODOs
(Planned improvements, areas for further research or development).
