# GPU Processing

Reserved directory for GPU-accelerated processing implementations.

## Purpose
This directory is designated for GPU-accelerated components of the AI4Deliberation pipeline.

## Status
Currently empty - reserved for future GPU-accelerated implementations such as:
- Accelerated text processing
- GPU-based model inference
- Parallel batch processing
- Large-scale embedding generation

## Potential Use Cases
- CUDA-accelerated text processing
- GPU-optimized transformer models
- Batch embedding generation
- Parallel document processing

## Requirements (when implemented)
- CUDA-capable GPU
- Appropriate CUDA toolkit
- GPU-accelerated libraries (e.g., cuDF, RAPIDS)
