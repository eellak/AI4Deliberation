# Gemma Summarization Task Documentation

This document describes the Gemma Summarization Task component, its objectives, architecture, and usage.

## 1. Overview
The primary goal of this component is to utilize Gemma language models for generating summaries of textual content, likely derived from public consultations or related legal documents processed by the AI4Deliberation pipeline.

It may involve:
- Preprocessing text for Gemma models.
- Implementing multi-stage summarization strategies (e.g., abstractive, extractive, iterative refinement).
- Handling potentially long documents.
- Evaluating summary quality.
