# TODO: Master Pipeline Integration

## Project Overview
Integration of modules for creating a database from Greek online consultations (opengov.gr) into an automated pipeline.

**Pipeline Components:**
1. **Scraper**: Re-scrape entire website or update existing DB with new deliberations
2. **HTML Pipeline**: Extract HTML to text using markdownify  
3. **PDF Pipeline**: Download and extract PDF content
4. **Rust Cleaning Pipeline**: Clean noisy PDF-to-markdown text, return cleaned text plus Greek/English percentages and badness score (0-1)
5. **Future Reference Detection Pipeline**: For Greek and EU legalese (not ready yet)

## Configuration System
**Location**: `config/pipeline_config.yaml`
**Environment Override Pattern**: `AI4D_*` environment variables override config values

## PHASE 7: Future Reference Detection Pipeline ğŸš§ DEFERRED

### Reference Detection Requirements
- [ ] Create reference detection integration module (DEFERRED - will integrate after core pipeline)

**Note**: Deferring this phase to focus on core pipeline integration and efficiency improvements.

---

## PHASE 8: Project Structure & Modular Organization ğŸ”„ IN PROGRESS

### Critical Architecture Issues Identified
- **Efficiency Problem**: Current Rust cleaning reads from DB then writes back (inefficient)
- **Solution**: Pipeline should flow: download â†’ extract â†’ clean â†’ store once
- **Need**: Modular project structure with clear APIs

### Project Restructuring Requirements
- [ ] Create unified master module structure following GitHub best practices
- [ ] Move existing components into modular format with clear boundaries
- [ ] Document API interfaces for each module (scraper, html, pdf, rust cleaning)
- [ ] Ensure efficient data flow: process content in memory before DB storage
- [ ] Create clear module separation with defined input/output contracts

### Implementation Steps
- [ ] Create `master_pipeline/` as main integration folder
- [ ] Reorganize existing modules (`scraper/`, `html_pipeline/`, `pdf_pipeline/`, `rust_pipeline/`)
- [ ] Define module APIs and data flow contracts
- [ ] Update configuration to support new modular structure
- [ ] Create module documentation with clear interfaces

---

## PHASE 9: Integrated End-to-End API ğŸ”„ NEXT

### Integration Requirements - CRITICAL
- [ ] **MANDATORY**: Fresh database schema recreation with backup
- [ ] Create single integrated API script for complete pipeline
- [ ] **MANDATORY**: End-to-end test with ONE new consultation
- [ ] **REQUIREMENT**: Must run to completion successfully before proceeding
- [ ] Efficient pipeline: scraping â†’ downloading â†’ extracting â†’ cleaning â†’ storing (single DB write)
- [ ] Complete verification: print all consultation data to verify correctness

### Pipeline Flow Design
```
New Consultation â†’ Scraper â†’ Articles/Documents â†’ 
PDF Download â†’ Content Extraction â†’ Rust Cleaning â†’ 
Database Storage (single write) â†’ Verification Output
```

### Deliverables
- [ ] Recreated database schema with backup
- [ ] `run_integrated_pipeline.py` - single entry point script
- [ ] End-to-end processing of one consultation with verification
- [ ] Performance metrics and success confirmation
- [ ] Complete data verification output

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: No progression to next phase until successful end-to-end run with full verification.
